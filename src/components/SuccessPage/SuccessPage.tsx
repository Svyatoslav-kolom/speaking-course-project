            When I heard that Nastia was launching the Public Speaking course, I
            realised that it was exactly what I needed. I used a lot of
            parasitic words, had too fast a speech rate, and because of this, I
            didn't have enough air during my speeches and my voice started to
            tremble. <br /> <br />
            From the first lesson, I was glad I joined. Nastia shared her life
            hacks and taught me cool breathing and stress reduction techniques.
            We analysed the structure of a report, learnt how to make pauses and
            accents, and how to maintain eye contact. <br /> <br />
            Nastya constantly encouraged us to step out of our comfort zone and
            work on ourselves. It was difficult: I rewrote my speeches dozens of
            times, constantly practised my breathing and diction, and tried my
            best to speak more slowly. <br /> <br />
            But all these efforts proved to be worthwhile, as I became more
            confident, minimised the use of parasitic words, and finally figured
            out how to keep the right pace and pause. <br /> <br />
            I saw not only my own progress, but also that of my fellow students.
            I sincerely rejoiced at their success and admired everyone's
            performances. <br /> <br />
            I am sincerely grateful to Nastya for her faith in our strength and
            support. It was an incredible experience that helped me become
            better and feel confident in my abilities. <br /> <br />
            The changes I have suggested are mainly related to punctuation and
            small stylistic corrections. Your writing style is quite good and
            reflects your thoughts in a clear and emotional way.

            I want to thank Anastasiia for her course and personal mentoring,
            the difference is immediately noticeable. First and foremost, my
            voice has stopped trembling; previously, I would have shortness of
            breath and make odd sounds during conversations when I ran out of
            air, but now I know how to deal with it and how to improve even
            more.
            <br /> <br />
            And my greatest achievement is EMOTIONS. It's laughable how anger,
            sadness, and joy used to be all in the same tone, but now I express
            them so vividly! And I consider this a success. <br /> <br />
            It's very important that I've become psychologically more open and
            confident. A special thanks for the meditations (I love them so
            much) and for the jokes that lightened the mood. <br /> <br />
            I sincerely thank Anastasiia for this course and for being a part of
            my life, it's a real reward, sending you a hug. <br /> <br />
            Guys, I can recommend Nastia's course with great respect and
            confidence. Beyond the knowledge and extensive practice, you'll gain
            awesome people in your circle, jokes, support, and self-discovery.{" "}

            I highly recommend Anastasiia's public speaking courses. Before
            starting the course, I had issues with self-esteem and fears of
            speaking in front of groups (for me, a group was already from two
            people). However, thanks to the courses, I realized that I needed to
            confront these difficulties.
            <br /> <br />
            Most importantly, I learned how to do this and now I'm applying
            these skills in practice. It's significant that the courses don't
            force you to overcome your fears; instead, through group sessions,
            you naturally begin to want to open up and be heard!
            <br /> <br />
            If you have the same fears as I did, give it a try - I'm confident
            you'll understand me after the course. <br /> <br />

            I was part of the first cohort of Nastia’s course, and I can say
            with certainty that it’s well worth the attention, and I’d love to
            go through it again. <br /> <br />
            Nastia is a true professional in her field. She will inspire you to
            speak differently. <br /> <br />
            When I was studying, I often spoke publicly and enjoyed it. But then
            the need for it faded, as this skill became unnecessary in my job.
            And now, as I'm learning again, the fear of public speaking has
            returned. The coolest thing Anastasiia does in her course is to help
            "draw out" your voice. And you begin to speak <br /> <br />I
            recorded the first video about 20 times, and the last one in one go.
            The course will help you to be heard, and in today’s world of social
            networks, your voice can work wonders. And Anastasiia in this course
            will help you achieve that.

            At the start, I genuinely thought I would just forget all my words,
            or worse, become as dull to the audience as an old history lecture.
            And honestly, it became tiring to think about how to avoid the
            pitfalls of filler words like "um" and "uh". <br /> <br />
            But thanks to the course, I gained many interesting tips that helped
            me manage stress and elevate my speaking level. For instance, I
            mastered the skill of using pauses, highlighting key points, and
            structuring my presentations, along with many other useful
            techniques.
            <br /> <br />
            I also enjoyed the practical assignments in the format of online
            meetings, where we analyzed different speakers' performances,
            discussed their techniques, and interacted with other course
            participants. Working in pairs was also very engaging. <br /> <br />
            Now, I can happily say that I express my thoughts more clearly, my
            Ukrainian has improved, and I know what's important in my
            presentations. I hardly have issues with filler words anymore — now
            I use pauses effectively and highlight the main points. Of course,
            there's always room to grow, especially in writing structured
            reports and controlling the tempo of speech, but I'm confident that
            I'll master these as well! <br /> <br />A big thank you to
            Anastasiia, she truly helped me in this process. And I recommend
            this course to anyone who wants to become a better speaker and
            perform in front of an audience.

            Before taking the course, I felt quite insecure when delivering
            speeches, especially when it came to starting them. <br /> <br />
            FDuring the course, I learned how to manage my fear, received and
            began to successfully apply Anastasiia's advice on engaging with the
            audience, and focused on personal development first and foremost.{" "}

            through my own difficulties. <br /> <br />
            Now, I can confidently say that I find it quite easy to compile
            information for an engaging speech, present it in a unique,

            speeches.
